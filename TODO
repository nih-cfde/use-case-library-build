Still broken:

- copy_images.py doesn't seem to work
- also need to make it copy over the stylesheets folder to output
- COC and LICENSE links from CONTRIBUTING are broken

Other CTB asks:

- dig into sed_fixes
- what does utilities.py do and do we need to move it here?
- Fix deploy/gh-deploy stuff in Snakefile

Amanda todos:
- add in rest of use Cases
- update CONTRIBUTING
- include the ID in all the output pages; right now when you go to the actual page for uc-0001, there's no indication that it's uc-0001 other than the URL.
