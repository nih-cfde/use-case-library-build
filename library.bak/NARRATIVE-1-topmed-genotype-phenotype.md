### Scientific Objective

The primary objective of many TOPMed research projects is to
identify genetic risk factors for biomedical phenotypes (such as
HDL cholesterol level in blood serum or diabetic disease status) via
genotype-phenotype association testing. These tests are often followed
by functional analyses of variants with established associations, with
the aim of identifying causal variants.
