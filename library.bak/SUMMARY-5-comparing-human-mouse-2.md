title: Comparing Human and Mouse (patient focused)
narratives: null

**Scenario:**

Gordon has a patient with a new phenotype. He wants to identify how common
this phenotype is, and is also looking for a molecular and genetic profile
associated with the phenotype. He wants to know if there is a model
organism with the same phenotype so he can explore this functionally.

**Current approach:**

Right now, Gordon would identify a genetic variant in his patient. He would
look through TOPMed to identify a cohort of individuals with similar
phenotypes. He would do a search to identify an associated gene then
look up the gene ID to identify associated data in GTEx. Then, he would run a
different search in model organism database to look for something that
looks similar. This is not simple, is very messy, and is time intensive.

**With Data Commons Phase 1:**

Gordon can access TOPMed, GTEx, and MODs data in one cloud workspace, conduct one
query to identify homologous data, and analyze relevant human and mouse
data simultaneously using pre-built infrastructure. He can link phenotypic,
genotypic data, as well as gene and protein expression data for human and mouse
because it is already transformed/harmonized, and use these to identify novel
associations with the phenotype.

**With Data Commons longer vision:**

He can make his work replicable by publishing his query and analysis in the Commons environment.
Gordon can work with developers in the Data Commons community to set
up an automatic update of the study as more human data is added.
