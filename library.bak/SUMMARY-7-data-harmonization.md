**Scenario:**

Zhong is trying to connect phenotypic variables from one study to
another. They are currently labeled differently and categorized in a
different data format even though the variables mean the same thing.

**Current approach:**

Right now Zhong would have to go through the time consuming process of trying to manually match variable names across
different studies. He might be able to use computer algorithms to aid in this task, but would still have to spend lots of time and money cleaning up the data.

**With Data Commons Phase 1:**

Zhong can use a common metadata model that will make data harmonization easier and more efficient.


**With Data Commons longer vision:**

Zhong can access a set of harmonization approaches
made available to all stacks through a network effect. This set is the
result of Data Commons users sharing previously harmonized data. Users
can collectively validate harmonization to increase trust in the metadata
model. Computer scientists will develop deep learning techniques to suggest
improvements to harmonization that are verified by the user community.
