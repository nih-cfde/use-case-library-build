**Scenario:**

Nancy wants to compare the effects of environmental factors such as diet and activity on phenotype. To do this she would compare the phenotypic profiles of many different rat strains, and record what phenotypic changes were consistent across different genotypic backgrounds. She would also compare the rat genotypes and phenotypes to human studies to identify particular rat strains that might mimic human cohorts for preclinical studies. Once she has a working pipeline, she wants to examine many other variables, such as the impacts of age and sex.

**Current approach:**

Nancy would have to utilize a lot of time and effort to accomplish this task.
