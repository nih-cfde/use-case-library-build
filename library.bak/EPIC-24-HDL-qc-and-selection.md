This is a hands-on/eyes-on problem. Measurements need to be checked for accuracy as much as possible, but also screened for batch effects that are confounded by other measurements (e.g. “men typically have higher HDL than women”). How to deal with these effects depends critically on the proposed study and analysis. Similarly, some measurement modalities and measurement granularity may be inappropriate for the desired study, so we need to surface the relevant study data and metadata and allow study selection.
