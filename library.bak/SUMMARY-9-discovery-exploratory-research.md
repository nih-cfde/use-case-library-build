**Scenario:**

Wesley has his own raw genetic dataset that he’d like to explore
further. He’s not really sure what he's looking for and wants to explore
his data in conjunction with other data sets to find relevant genes
that are co-expressed or maybe tissues to look at. Phenotypic and
functional data would be good to explore in the future so he wants to
save his initial exploration to build on.

**Current approach:**

Wesley would only be able to do this on a small scale. It is a bit like hunt and peck.

**With Data Commons Phase 1:**

There are new standards for making datasets discoverable and interoperable
(including harmonization of metadata). The Data Commons use of FAIR principles for
data allows Wesley to analyze across genetic, phenotypic, and
functional data on a cloud-based platform and label query results so that they can be retrieved
at a later date. Infrastructure is now available to support exploratory research in a
cost and time effective manner.

**With Data Commons longer vision:**

Wesley's dataset can be used as a query against other datasets. He can share raw
data in the Data Commons so it is accessible by other
researchers. There is now a marketplace for finding datasets that others have
contributed to collaborate on. There are also policies around intellectual property
that encourage collaboration, open science, as well as protecting researchers.
