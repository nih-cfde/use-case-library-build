**Scientific Objective**
Associate measures of high density lipoprotein genotype and disease phenotype.

**Notes**
We define “data” as “anything that is access restricted” and “metadata” as “anything that is not access restricted”. For example, “age is measured in this study” is not access restricted, while “the age of the subject at the time of this measurement was 55” is access restricted.
