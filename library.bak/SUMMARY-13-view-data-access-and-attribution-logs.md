**Scenario:**

Joe, the provider of a resource on the Data Commons, is preparing a report documenting how frequently his resource is being used by consumers in the community. He would like to know if his resource is properly credited/acknowledged.

**Current approach:**

Joe would need to keep a personal log of access to his data, and use PubMed and similar search engines to find instances where his data had been cited, but generally wouldn't be able to track un-cited uses.

**With Data Commons Phase 1:**

In addition to his own, internal logs, Joe can request logs of usernames for all Commons users who accessed his data.

**With Data Commons longer vision:**

Joe can access the Data Commons user interface for querying the data access log. The user interface allows him to specify his search criteria, which include the UID of his resource(s) within the Data Commons as well as the start date and end date for the time window heâ€™s interested in. The process returns all logged activity for the specified resources during the specified time window.
