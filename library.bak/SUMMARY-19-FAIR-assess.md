**Scenario:**

Andrew wants to make his group's digital research objects more findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). This will be a critical step for getting his group's data to be widely used by data scientists.

**Current approach:**

Andrew would have to come up with his own solution. Software to systematically assess, store and display the FAIRness of biomedical digital objects is not currently available.

**With Data Commons Phase 1:**

Andrew can use the FAIRshake software toolkit to assess the compliance of his group's biomedical research objects.
FAIR guiding principles have been established by the community, and FAIRshake functions as a repository to store and serve FAIR assessments. Now, Andrew can start projects, contribute metrics and rubrics, and perform and display FAIR assessments.

**With Data Commons longer vision:**

After he completes his FAIR assessment Andrew can see what parts of his digital object repository need work, and can put resources into improving the FAIRness of his data. After some community building, led by the Data Commons, Andrew may find that members of the FAIR community have also assessed his repository, and have noticed things he didn't. Once he is happy with the status of his own data, Andrew begins to set aside time each month to assess new community datasets for FAIRness, and help newcomers learn the FAIRshake system.
