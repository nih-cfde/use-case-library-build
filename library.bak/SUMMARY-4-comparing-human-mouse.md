title: Comparing Human and Mouse
narratives: null

**Scenario:**

Two research teams independently found a novel phenotype. Lilly's team has
a patient cohort with the phenotype and are looking for a molecular
and genetic profile associated with the phenotype. Amerie's team has
identified the same phenotype in mice. The teams found each other at a
conference and think their studies are related â€“ now they want to
collaborate to determine the root of the phenotype.

**Current approach:**

Right now, the labs would work independently in their respective
models. They would analyze data separately and compare notes. Lilly's lab
might send a grad student or post doc to visit Amerie's lab for
collaborative research. Their analysis workflows would be
incompatible.

**With Data Commons Phase 1:**

The two teams can share a cloud workspace, access and analyze relevant
human and mouse data simultaneously, and share insights with a
pre-built infrastructure. They can link phenotypic, genotypic, gene
and protein expression data for human and mouse because it is already
transformed/harmonized to identify novel associations with the
phenotype.

**With Data Commons longer vision:**

The two teams find each other through results that are published in
the Commons environment. They are able to tailor their analysis
pipeline. They work with developers in the Data Commons community to
set up an automatic update of their collaborative study as more human
data is added to TOPMed.
