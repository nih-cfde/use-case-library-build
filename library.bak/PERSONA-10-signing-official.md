Signing Official (SO) is a role in the eRA Commons, and may be assigned to people with widely varying backgrounds. At a university, the SO is likely someone who works in the Office of Sponsored Research or equivalent. At a private company, it will likely be the CEO. Although some Signing Officials may be comfortable with programing and/or data science, a typical SO is not expected to have command line computing or bioinformatics experience.
