**Scenario**

As Signing Official, Marion would like to be able to pre-authorize researchers at her institution to access Commons datasets, rather than having to re-sign for each request to access data.

**Current Approach**

Marion would have to authorize each researcher at her university one at a time, and could only authorize them by specific request.

**With the Data Commons Phase I**



**With Data Commons longer vision:**

Marion can log in to her Data Commons account and fill out the necessary paperwork for her university. Upon acceptance, Marion can then apply her university's privileges to both current and future researchers at her university.
