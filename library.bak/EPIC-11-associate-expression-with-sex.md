a. Perform alignment of the FASTQ files representing the GTEx raw data
following quality control with a method such as Yet Another RNA
Normalization software pipeline (YARN). Align the reads against the
hg38 genomes using STAR or another aligner. Provide quality control
metrics.

b. Analyze alternative splicing events (ASE) using rMATS or another
appropriate tool. Assemble the results of the analysis into a matrix
that can be stored as a file or otherwise to enable statistical
analysis.
