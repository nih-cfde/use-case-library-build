By contributing to this repository, you agree: To obey the Code of Conduct To release all your contributions under the same terms as the license itself: the CC-BY Attribution 4.0 International If you are OK with these two conditions, then we welcome both you and your contribution! How to add content If you have a suggestion for a new use case concept and are not familiar with GitHub, you can email your idea to us . If you are familiar with GitHub please either: Open a NewUseCase issue describing your new use case idea Or write up your use case and submit it as a pull request (PR). Please follow the Use Case Style Guide below. PR process If you are submitting a pull request, please create one pull request per use case so admin can check the complete change. First, add and preview new changes: Fork the use cases repo and create a new branch in your forked version. Use the use case file templates to format and add your new use case files to the appropriate directories on your branch. After you add changes to your branch, you should see a message near the top of the repo page indicating that your branch is x number of commits ahead of nih-cfde:master . There should be a button for 'Pull request' and/or 'Compare' - they lead to the same page to create a PR. Submit a PR from your forked repo branch to the nih-cfde:preview branch. After you submit the PR, make sure the repo checks complete (green check mark) If the checks complete successfully, the repo's bot will auto-merge your changes to the preview branch. Please check your changes on the preview website . It may take ~30 minutes for the changes you added to show up. Please check that the new content renders correctly (e.g., check page format, right-side table of contents links, and page and web hyperlinks) and makes sense relative to existing content. If the checks failed, please submit a HelpWanted issue to request help. Please include a reference (using # ) to your PR so we can check the correct website build logs.

If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c.

However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d.

There are several known movement-related disorders, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, Parkinson's disease, Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). A few common features of these neuromuscular disorders are that they all involve the brain, share many symptoms, and are all difficult to diagnose in their early stages. Natasha is interested in scanning what data already exists that may help in identifying key genomic, transcriptomic and/or proteomic differences between these conditions along with potential biomarkers that may aide in early diagnosis and/or targeted drug development. Natasha navigates to the CFDE portal, and searches by collection. They start by searching all columns for \"IPSC\" (induced pluripotent stem cell) lines, which gives a manageable 19 records. Natasha browses the descriptions for the these results, and the uses the \"Part of Collection\" filter to select only the 9 that best fit their plan. Natasha exports this list of desirable data sets to save. Natasha then decides that they would also like to include neural stem cells in their experimental design. They click 'clear all filters' and then repeat their search with \"stem cell neu\", and export that list as well. Since the CFDE portal uses a single standardized export format, Natasha easily combines the two exported files into a single cohort with datasets from LINCS and Metabolomics. Natasha can then use the persistent_id to go actually obtain the data files (or request access to them) at their parent portal.

There are several known movement-related disorders, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, Parkinson's disease, Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). A few common features of these neuromuscular disorders are that they all involve the brain, share many symptoms, and are all difficult to diagnose in their early stages. Natasha is interested in scanning what data already exists that may help in identifying key genomic, transcriptomic and/or proteomic differences between these conditions along with potential biomarkers that may aide in early diagnosis and/or targeted drug development. Natasha navigates to the CFDE portal, and searches by collection. They start by searching all columns for \"IPSC\" (induced pluripotent stem cell) lines, which gives a manageable 19 records. Natasha browses the descriptions for the these results, and the uses the \"Part of Collection\" filter to select only the 9 that best fit their plan. Natasha exports this list of desirable data sets to save. Natasha then decides that they would also like to include neural stem cells in their experimental design. They click 'clear all filters' and then repeat their search with \"stem cell neu\", and export that list as well. Since the CFDE portal uses a single standardized export format, Natasha easily combines the two exported files into a single cohort with datasets from LINCS and Metabolomics. Natasha can then use the persistent_id to go actually obtain the data files (or request access to them) at their parent portal.","title":"Description"},{"location":"uc-0007/#tasks-for-this-use-case","text":"t-0001: Access CFDE interface \u2705 June 2020 t-0018: Search/filter data sets by biosample \u2705 June 2020 t-0006: Search/filter data sets by anatomic terms \u2705 June 2020 t-0005: Search/filter data by assay type terms \u2705 June 2020 t-0019: Search/filter data sets by project \u2705 June 2020 t-0003: Export a file of results \u2705 June 2020","title":"Tasks for this use case:"},{"location":"uc-0007/#requirements-for-this-use-case","text":"r-00001: The interface will support GUI web access to end users \u2705 June 2020 r-00034: The interface will support the selection of a biosample of interest \u2705 June 2020 r-00035: The C2M2 model will support information relating biosamples to CF programs \u2705 June 2020 r-00036: The catalog will store information relating Uberon terms to CF programs \u2705 June 2020 r-00003: The interface will support the selection of an Uberon term of interest \u2705 June 2020 r-00004: The C2M2 model will support information relating anatomy terms to CF programs \u2705 June 2020 r-00005: The catalog will store information relating anatomy terms to CF programs \u2705 June 2020 r-00006: The interface will support the selection of an assay type term of interest \u2705 June 2020 r-00007: The C2M2 model will support information relating assay types to CF programs \u2705 June 2020 r-00008: The catalog will store information relating assay types to CF programs \u2705 June 2020 r-00010: The catalog will store information relating projects to CF programs \u2705 June 2020 r-00011: The C2M2 model will support information relating projects to CF programs \u2705 June 2020 r-00014: The interface will support end user download of tables and figures in common formats \u2705 June 2020","title":"Requirements for this use case:"}]}
