By contributing to this repository, you agree: To obey the Code of Conduct To release all your contributions under the same terms as the license itself: the CC-BY Attribution 4.0 International If you are OK with these two conditions, then we welcome both you and your contribution to the CFDE project! Developing a new use case Each use case must include: a persona an objective a summary of the objective specific user tasks technical infrastructure requirements associated with user tasks Start by drafting the components of your new use case idea and then read through the use case library's existing persona, objective, user task, and requirement definitions. If any of them apply to your new use case, please reuse them ! For example, multiple use cases may involve the persona \"clinical researcher\" (p-001) or the user task \"access CFDE interface\" (t-0001), so these existing files can be referenced in the new use case files and do not need to be recreated. As necessary, you can also create new persona, objective, user task, or requirement files (see below for file naming guidelines ). In particular, requirement files define the technical implementation for what needs to happen in user tasks. These may be difficult to define. You can include ideas for requirements with your use case submission and/or request help and we will reach out to the CFDE technical team for guidance. Please see the Use Case Library Style Guide for format instructions. Suggesting a new use case If you have a suggestion for a new use case concept and are not familiar with GitHub, you can email your idea to us . If you are familiar with GitHub please either: Open a NewUseCase issue describing your new use case idea Or write up your use case and submit it as a pull request (PR) ( instructions below ). Use Case approval process Please allow up to one week for admin to review your suggestion. For use cases submitted as PRs, the Use Case committee will mark proposed use cases, and corresponding user task and requirement pages, with status and completion date. This information is added to the yaml headers : in progress = \u23f3 approved = \ud83d\udc4c done = \u2705 Please do not delete these values as you edit files! We use these markers to keep track of complete use case files. Getting help If you have any questions about contributing, please submit an issue and we will lend a hand as soon as possible: Issue templates About NewUseCase issue To describe and suggest a new use case idea Enhancements issue To suggest general improvements to the Use Case Library HelpWanted issue To request general help Bug report issue To report a bug Previewing content and submitting PR If you are submitting a pull request, please create one pull request per new use case so admin can check the complete change. Please check that the new additions render correctly on the website before submitting the PR by rendering the website locally on your computer. You will need to make a Github account and install git and conda (e.g., by downloading Miniconda. (MacOS Miniconda tutorial) ) on your computer. The instructions below have been tested on MacOS. 1. Fork the use case library repo and create a new branch in your forked version. For those onboarded to the CFDE, you may have permissions to edit the use case library repo directly instead of forking, in which case, start at step 2. 2. Clone the repository to your local computer. Be sure to edit the command below with the correct Github user name: git clone https://github.com/<your user name here>/use-case-library-build.git cd use-case-library-build If you have permissions to edit the repo directly: git clone https://github.com/nih-cfde/use-case-library-build.git cd use-case-library-build 3. Create a conda environment to specify the software used to build the use case library website. The name of the environment is specified by the -n flag, for example \"usecaselibrary\". The -f flag specifies the file that has all the software requirements. This website stores those requirements in a file called \"environment.yml\". Once you have made the conda environment, you can skip to step 4 for future edits (assuming you don't delete this conda environment!). conda env create -n usecaselibrary -f environment.yml 4. Activate the conda environment. conda activate usecaselibrary 5. Now, either make a branch or switch to the branch you're making edits on if it already exists (e.g., if you created a branch on Github, you can switch to work on the remote branch). # make branch git branch <name of branch> # switch to local branch git checkout <name of branch> # OR switch to remote branch git checkout --track origin/<name of branch> New use case files should ONLY be added to the library directory . Please do not change any other files in the repository to prevent website rendering issues! Use the use case file templates to format and add your new use case files to the library directory on your branch. 6. After you've added the new use case files, preview how they look on the website! The website is built using snakemake rules. First, build the website's output directory. This should be done once. The -j flag specifies the number of cores to use; -j 1 is sufficient for this website. snakemake -j 1 7. Generate the local render of the website. Scripts in this repository take the new files from the library directory, format them according to the website's stylesheets, and render them on the website. snakemake serve --use-conda -j 1 Your terminal should show the following if the local render succeeds: INFO - Building documentation... INFO - Cleaning site directory INFO - Building documentation to directory: /var/folders/2k/dcjr_t3151z_s1yq8mlcv3f80000gn/T/mkdocs_alu91pc_ INFO - Documentation built in 0.35 seconds INFO - Running at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/ INFO - Hold ctrl+c to quit. If this command executes successfully, copy the web address ( http://127.0.0.1:8000/ ) to a web browser to check the changes you made. This is the local, offline version of the website! Note that if you continue to edit documents, you will need to use the ctrl+c keys on your keyboard to close the server, save changes, and re-run the snakemake serve -j 1 command to view new changes. 8. If you are satisfied with the changes, you can add, commit, and push the changes to your forked repo. # add all new changes git add . # commit changes git commit -am \"short description of new changes\" # push changes git push origin <name of branch> # if you want to push a new local branch that is not on the remote repo yet # add the -u flag (also known as --set-upstream) # git push -u origin <name of branch> If you are done working on the website, you can exit the conda environment to return to your base terminal environment. conda deactivate 9. After you push changes to your branch, you should see a message near the top of the Github repo page indicating that your branch is x number of commits ahead of nih-cfde:latest . There should be a button for \"Pull request\" and/or \"Compare\" - they lead to the same page to create a PR. Submit a PR pushing changes from your branch to nih-cfde:latest . Request reviews from Use Case maintainers by typing @ACharbonneau and @marisalim in your PR text box. Please check the to do list in the PR text box (e.g., is the PR mergeable?, etc.). You can continue to edit your PR after it has been submitted! Please allow up to one week for admin to review your request. If you need help at any point in this process, please submit a HelpWanted issue ! Please include a reference (using # ) to your PR number so we can check the correct submission. Use Case Library Style Guide General File Format Guidelines File names should be lower case, use hyphens between words, and match the page titles (but try to keep them concise). All files should include a unique file ID. As indicated below, please add the appropriate number of leading 0's to the file IDs. The Use Case committee will finalize file IDs to ensure they do not clash with existing IDs. File type File prefix Example use case uc-0000 uc-0001-researcher-browse-and-filter.md persona p-000 p-001-clinical-researcher.md objective obj-0000 obj-0001-create-data-release.md user task t-0000 t-0001-access-cfde-interface.md requirement r-00000 r-00001-the-interface-will-support-gui-web-access-to-end-users.md The file format for all files should be written in Markdown. For help with Markdown syntax, see this basic syntax guide . Yaml headers The site index is automatically created by yaml headers at the top of each file. These headers will automatically render links to a use case's corresponding persona, objective, user task, and requirements files. The Use Case committee will check yaml headers to ensure the indices do not clash with existing files. Yaml format begins and ends with \"---\". Every use case library page should have a title: key. For the use case (uc-0000), user task (t-0000), and requirement (r-00000) files, additional keys and values are required (see file sections for details ). The completed: and tutorial: keys must be included in the yaml header, but their values should be left empty; the Use Case committee will fill them in. The goal: key may be filled in with applicable CFDE program goals or left for the Use Case committee to fill in. The other additional keys ( persona: , objective: , user_tasks: , requirements: ) are followed by a colon \":\" and their corresponding values are listed after with a hyphen \"-\" and the file ID. These yaml keys may have one or more values. For example, the requirements: key below is linked to the r-00003 and r-00004 requirements file IDs and the completed: key is left empty: --- title: example user task completed: requirements: - r-00003 - r-00004 --- Specific File Format Guidelines Use Case files Use the use case file template to enter the required sections Each use case file submission must reference four types of file in the yaml header for the website to render properly: 1 or more persona files 1 or more objective files 1 or more user task files 1 or more requirement files Required sections: yaml index header, including keys for title: , completed: , tutorial: , goal: , persona: , objective: , user_tasks: , and requirements: . The completed: , and tutorial: keys should be left empty; the Use Case committee will add information during the approval process . Optional: You can fill in the goal: key according to the list of CFDE program goals . a short summary of the use case Persona files Use the persona file template to enter the required sections Required sections: yaml index header with title: Short description of the persona's biological/computational experience, their role and responsibilities, and relation to any of the other personas in the Use Case Library A bullet point section listing assumptions about the persona e.g., access to the CFDE Objective files Use the objective file template to enter the required sections Required sections: yaml index header with title: a brief ~1-2 sentence description of the objective User task files Use the user task file template to enter the required sections The User Tasks title should be short and self-explanatory Each user task must reference 1 or more requirements in the yaml header for the website to render properly. This list should include the subset of requirements corresponding to the specific user task that are listed in the use case file's yaml requirements section. Required sections: yaml index header with title: , completed: , and requirements: . The completed: key should be left empty; the Use Case committee will add information during the approval process . a brief ~1-2 sentence description of the user task Requirement files Use the requirement file template to enter the required sections The Requirements title should be short and self-explanatory. Required sections: yaml index header with title: and completed: . The completed: key should be left empty; the Use Case committee will add information during the approval process . a brief ~1-2 sentence description of the requirement CFDE Program goals and objectives The following four goals may be added to the use case file yaml header if appropriate. For example, this is the beginning of the yaml header for the \"Researcher Browse and Filter\" use case: --- title: Researcher Browse and Filter completed: tutorial: goal: Enhance the ability to ask scientific questions across data sets --- The four key goals of the CFDE are detailed below: Goal 1: Enhance the ability to ask scientific questions across data sets 1a. Novel scientific and clinical research is enabled through cross-data set discovery 1b. A standard Authentication/Authorization (AuthN/AuthZ) strategy is implemented to permit appropriate access to and compute on controlled access data 1c. (Eval only) CFDE activities are having a positive impact on CF DCCs\u2019 ability to manage and use data Goal 2: Enable the uptake, reuse, and addition of NIH data and tools from future, current, and ended programs 2a. Data and metadata structure, descriptions, and organization are optimized so data can be found and combined across data sets 2b. Common standards, methods, tools, and processes are provided enabling data managers to load, update, maintain and version, and monitor data sets on the cloud 2c. Common tools and processes are provided to assess and improve FAIR-ness of data and other digital objects to optimize the query, retrieval, and use 2d. A central, externally facing, scalable portal is provided, serving as the directory to all CF data sets and tools, FAIR-ness metrics, use cases, and the like 2e. CF DCCs and their users are engaged in the design of self-governed standards applicable to existing and future CF data programs Goal 3: Support the storage, sharing, and sustainability of CF data sets 3a. CF data sets are stored and managed in cloud environments to increase availability and accessibility of key data sets 3b. CF Programs use the STRIDES agreements for storage and compute, leveraging pre-paid funding from the CF 3c. NIH retains ownership and oversight of data sets after programs have ended 3d. Practices and policies that can accommodate new CF programs are adopted Goal 4: Provide training that maximizes a scientist\u2019s ability to upload data and use CF data and other resources 4a. Training material is provided for researchers to access, analyze and understand the CF data sets and tools provided by CF Programs 4b. Use case scenarios are posted to the Data Ecosystem community 4c. A Data Ecosystem user guide and site documentation are created and accessible","title":"Contributing Guide"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#contributing-to-the-nih-cfde-use-case-library","text":"Hello, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the CFDE Use Case Library!

Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public . Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. Section 1 \u2013 Definitions. a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. e.

Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. k.

The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. Downstream recipients. A. Offer from the Licensor \u2013 Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

Other rights. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 \u2013 License Conditions.

For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 \u2013 Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Focuses on resources required, method(s) followed, and outcome(s) targeted. Can be validated with scientific stakeholders. Persona A type of user who will appear in the epics and stories that follow. Summary A high-level, non-technical description of an entire Use Case. The user in each summary has a name, a scientific or administrative problem, and both proximate and ultimate goals. The focus is on the problem and what is generally needed to solve it. User Task A story, told from the user's perspective that captures a concrete step in a users interactions with tools (e.g. software solutions) in the service of achieving the scientific objective. Must be written in terms that are meaningful to the user, from their perspective. This can be thought of as one in a series of medium scale tasks that must be completed to answer the question posed in the scientific objective. The list of User Task in a Use Case should cover everything the user needs to achieve their goal, even interactions that don't involve the software or data from the Common Fund. Requirement A well-scoped and defined piece of software or data engineering work that is needed to support a User Task.

In AML, the affected myeloid cells, a type of white blood cells, are not functional and build up in the bone marrow leaving reduced capacity for healthy white and red blood cells. While risk factors for developing AML exist, often times the underlying cause remains unknown. Gene mutations and chromosomal abnormality in the leukemia cells occur sporadically. Characterization of the wide spectrum of genetic events involved in AML will aide in better understanding of its etiology and ultimately in development of improved therapy. Amberose would like to combine whole genome sequencing (WGS) data with global transcriptomic profiling using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to look for functional dysregulation of a few genes. They know that there are likely already data sets created by NIH researchers that they could use for their initial hypothesis generation, and decide to start by searching Common Fund data at the CFDE portal. Amberose navigates to the CFDE portal, and searches by Biosample, then filters that list by Anatomy, and searches within those results for 'blood' and 'venous blood'. They then filter these results to keep only whole genome sequencing assay (WGS) and RNA-seq assay values. Amberose then looks at the \"Project\" filter and finds that the several thousand results in their search belong to only 17 projects. By reading the project information for each, Amberose narrows their search down to the two that seem the most applicable: Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)and TARGET: Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Amberose exports the list of files that belong to those two projects, which they can use to actually obtain these files (or request access to them) at their parent portals (Kids First and GTEx).
