By contributing to this repository, you agree: To obey the Code of Conduct . To release all your contributions under the same terms as the Use Case Library license itself: the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (aka Public Domain) license. If you are OK with these two conditions, then we welcome both you and your contribution! If you have any questions about contributing, please open an issue and Team Copper will lend a hand ASAP. Thank you for being here and for being a part of the DCPPC project. Quick Start To suggest a new Use Case and provide some text: Make a copy of this form Fill in as much information as possible Create an issue here Copy the text of the form into the issue box, or attach it as a comment If you are already familiar with the Use Case Library: Make a new branch from latest master . See below for more details Create a new SUMMARY-, PERSONA-, NARRATIVE-, USERSTORY-, or EPIC- file under library/ by copying an existing file. Make sure that the filename specifies a unique ID (e.g. SUMMARY-1-xyz yields the ID SUMMARY-1 which is not unique) Update the YAML metadata at the top of the file to reflect your new metadata Edit the markdown description below the YAML header (Optional) Build the file using snakemake, check the output. Iterate until you're happy Add a new file to git repo, commit, push Set up a Pull Request to merge into master and tag in @ctb Uncle Archie will check out a copy of your pull request, run a snakemake build on it, and link to the output of the build process, so you can use Uncle Archie instead of using snakemake locally Detailed contributor guidelines File Name Conventions For maximum flexibility, each part of a Use Case is stored in it's own markdown file. Different components of the library follow slightly different naming conventions, however they all share two characteristics: Filenames begin with the component type in ALLCAPS The component type is followed by -<digit> where the digit is a number that does not already occur in that component set For Epics, Narratives, Personas, and Summaries, the digit is additionally followed by a short description of the contents of the file, where spaces are replaced with - . For User Stories, no description is added to the file name. Examples: EPIC-1-develop-plan-for-association-testing.md NARRATIVE-1-topmed-genotype-phenotype.md PERSONA-5-data-provider.md SUMMARY-1-topmed-genotype-phenotype.md USERSTORY-6.md The numbers included in each filename are to ensure uniqueness. There is no requirement that all numbers are used in the library or that they occur in a particular order within a Use Case. Writing a Use Case A finished Use Case must be associated with a Persona, and have a Scientific Objective, a Summary, and a number of User Epics and User Stories that comprise it's User Narrative. Use Case Component Specificity Occurences per Use Case Persona Can be used by multiple UCs 1 Scientific Objective Can be used by a single UC 1 Summary Can be used by a single UC 1 User Narrative Can be used by a single UC 1 User Epic Can be used by a single UC 1 - 10 User Story Can be used by multiple UCs 1 - any Personas A Persona is a general description of a type of user. As these are general archetypes, most contributors will not need to create a new Persona. A Persona file has five parts: title: this is 1 - 5 words that describe a user blurb: < 10 words that add more description tags: a carriage return seperated list of relevant 1 - 2 word descriptions A long form description of the user, detailing their strengths and weaknesses as they relate to computational science. YAML front matter block: The YAML sub-section of the file containing the title, blurb and tags should be bounded by --- Example: --- title: Biological data scientist blurb: A researcher with some scripting skills tags: - biological - data scientist --- A bioinformatician or researcher with some scripting skills, capable of using and combining pre-established pipelines, and doing exploratory data analysis in R/RStudio or Python/Jupyter Notebook. Use Case Summary A Summary is a high-level, non-technical description of an entire Use Case, written in the third-person. The user in each summary should have a name, a problem, and both proximate and ultimate goals. Although these are based on general archetypes, each Use Case will have it's own unique summary, and the user should be a relatable individual rather than a faceless abstraction. The Summary also includes multiple solutions to the user's problem. A Summary file has eight parts: Title: this 1 - 5 words that describe the summary Narratives: the abbreviated file name of the narrative that is tied to this summary, formatted as a single-item list (i.e. NARRATIVE-# ) Tags: a carriage return separated list of relevant 1 - 2 word descriptions Scenario: A long form description of a named user, including their proximate and ultimate goals, available resources, problems with reaching those goals and individual abilities Current Approaches: A long form description of how this user might approach their problems, given current non-Data Commons technology With the Data Commons Phase I: A long form description of how this user might attain their goals more easily using Data Commons resources With Data Commons longer vision: A long form description of how this user will be able to accomplish their goals by using future technologies being created by the Data Commons YAML front matter block: The YAML sub-section of the file containing the title, narratives and tags should be bounded by --- Example: ( See the full file here ) --- title: TOPmed Genotype-Phenotype Association Testing narratives: - NARRATIVE-1 tags: - TOPMed genotype-phenotype --- **Scenario** Geraldine is a biomedical researcher who wants to look for genetic variants associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) by performing Genome Wide Association Analysis (GWAS), using genotypes from whole genome sequence (WGS). A large sample size is needed for statistical power to detect... **Current Approach** Without the Commons, Geraldine would have to find and download several datasets to build a large synthetic cohort. It is likely that different studies would have annotated their data differently, making it difficult... **With the Data Commons Phase I** Geraldine logs into her favorite full stack and searches for dbGaP studies with WGS-genotypes and CAD phenotypes. She is able to find CAD-related phenotypes in multiple studies, even though they use different variable names... **With Data Commons longer vision:** Geraldine now has the ability to search many more data repositories to find CAD-related studies. When she finds new studies, she is able to apply for access easily using a Data Commons interface... User Narrative A User Narrative file references the collection of User Epics and User Stories for a given Use Case, and also contains the text of the Scientfic Objective. Each Use case has it's own User Narrative file. A User Narrative file has seven parts: title: 1 - 5 words that describe the Use Case persona: this is the exact file name of the persona for this Use Case without the file extension blurb: < 10 word description of Use Case epics: a carriage return seperated list of the abbreviated file names of Epics associated with this Use Case (i.e. EPIC-# ). tags: a carriage return seperated list of relevant 1 - 2 word descriptions Scientific Objective: A long form description of moderatly detailed scientific question. It should be domain and subject specific, but should not reference a specific user or any specific tools for answering the question. YAML front matter block: The YAML sub-section of the file containing the title, blurb and tags should be bounded by --- Example: --- title: TOPmed Genotype-phenotype association testing persona: PERSONA-1-biological-data-scientist blurb: Identify genetic risk factors for biomedical phenotypes epics: - EPIC-1 - EPIC-2 - EPIC-3 tags: - TOPMed genotype-phenotype - biomedical phenotypes - genetic risk factors --- ### Scientific Objective The primary objective of many TOPMed research projects is to identify genetic risk factors for biomedical phenotypes (such as HDL cholesterol level in blood serum or diabetic disease status) via genotype-phenotype association testing. These tests are often followed by functional analyses of variants with established associations, with the aim of identifying causal variants.` User Epic A User Epic is a short description that captures a valuable set of interactions with tools (e.g. software solutions) in the service of achieving the scientific objective. Epics can also be thought of as big tasks, and should be written from the users perspective, e.g.: \"build a dataset\" or \"analyze a dataset\" or \"turn raw sequence into called variants\". Importantly, an Epic is a multi-step process, which will later be broken down into small component parts (User Stories). Most Use Cases will have between three and five Epics, however very simple Use Cases may have only one, and very complex Use Cases may have ten or more. User Epics are tied to specific Use Cases, and can not be shared. A User Epic file has six parts: title: 1 - 5 words that describe the Epic blurb: < 20 word description of Epic task user-stories: a carriage return seperated list of the abbreviated file names of the User Stories associated with this Epic (i.e. USERSTORY-# ). tags: a carriage return seperated list of relevant 1 - 2 word descriptions untitled description: An optional long form description of the task. This can be quite detailed and include specific file types, statistical analyses, and techniques. It should be domain and subject specific, and can give context for the User Stories. YAML front matter block: The YAML sub-section of the file containing the title, blurb, user-stories, and tags should be bounded by --- Example: --- title: Associate expression with sex blurb: Associate differences in gene expression with sex user-stories: - USERSTORY-47 - USERSTORY-48 tags: - gene expression --- Perform alignment of the FASTQ files representing the GTEx raw data following quality control with a method such as Yet Another RNA Normalization software pipeline (YARN). Align the reads against the hg38 genomes using STAR or another aligner. Provide quality control metrics.` User Story A User Story is a short description of a very specific step of a larger task (the Epic). User Stories will usually have two inputs and one output. The a USERSTORY is a single step task where INPUT_A + INPUT_B = OUTPUT. In most cases, the output from one User Story will be one of the two 'inputs' for a subsequent User Story in an Epic. Likewise, the last output from one Epic will likely be the input for the first User Story of the next Epic in a User Narrative. Most Use cases will have between three and five Epics, and each of those will be associated with between two and five User Stories. Unlike most other Use Case Components, User Stories can be shared across Use Cases. A User Story file has five parts: input: Usually two, but sometimes one or three files, tools or abilities which are necessary to begin this task output: Usualy one, but occasionally two files or abilities gained by completing this task task: a single operation that turns the input into output tags: a carriage return seperated list of relevant 1 - 2 word descriptions YAML front matter block: The YAML sub-section of the file containing all the text of this file should be bounded by --- Important Note The text from a User Story is programatically transformed into a sentence, so the input, output and task must be written such that they complete the sentence: Use <input> to <task> to generate <output> Example: --- input: a financial transaction output: an NIH compatible account task: purchasing access to NIH Data Commons platform(s) tags: - financial - Amazon Web Services - Google Cloud Platform - responsibility commitment --- Additional Context Although the Use Case library is generally read from the top down, you may find it easier to begin by detailing all the concrete, individual steps as User Stories. User Stories grouped by the overall technical task they help achieve become User Epics. The biological reason for completing the Epics can then become the Scientific Objective, and a high level description of \"Why is this objective important?\" can be the basis for your Summary. Worked Example of an Epic and its User Stories If your Epic is \"Build a dataset\" then your User Stories might be: 1) input: list of candidate genes + several databases of expression data output: expression data for candidate genes task: search for candidate genes in database 2) input: expression data for candidate genes and some metadata output: expression data combined with metadata task: merge expression data with its metadata 3) input: expression data with metadata from several databases and domain expertise output: one expression dataset with metadata task: harmonize datasets Building the Site A brief overview of how the site is built The Markdown files in library/ define a collection of high-level use case library items: summaries, personas, narratives, user epics, and user stories. These files provide three types of information: a unique identifier , given by the TYPE-NUMBER in the filename; so SUMMARY-1-topmed-genotype-phenotype has the identifier SUMMARY-1 . metadata , stored in the YAML header at the top of the file contents; this metadata links between object types. markdown content describing the library item in more detail. The script scripts/process.py processes each library item, checking the content of the item and assembling links to other library items, and uses templates to build an mkdocs -ready static site in output/docs/ , with the mkdocs configuration file at output/mkdocs.yml . The processing step uses Jinja for templating (see templates/ directory). The use case library static site is built from the automatically-generated mkdocs site materials. The result is static HTML that can be deployed on a web server served or using Github Pages. The final static site files are located in output/site/ . The file output/site/index.html is the main entry point. Optional: Building the site locally for testing The Use Case Library uses Uncle Archie (a home-brewed continuous integration server that runs pull request checks) to deploy a test version of the website each time a pull request is opened or updated. Thus, you do not need to build the test site locally. However, it is still useful to build a local version of the Use Case Library site to test out local changes. To do this, the steps are as follows: Clone a local copy of this repo Set up a Python virtual environment Build and test the site locally We walk through each of these steps below. Clone a local copy Clone a local copy of the repository and cd into that directory: git clone https://github.com/dcppc/use-case-library.git && cd use-case-library Set up virtual environment Create a Python virtual environment, which will give you a clean version of Python that won't get mixed up with your default/system Python. (Note that each of the following commands should be executed in a Bash shell, not a Python shell.) Do these steps once: Create a virtual environment in the repo directory: virtualenv vp This will take a minute. The virtual environment lives in the vp/ directory and anything installed into your virtual environment will be located in the vp/ directory. To activate your virtual environment: source vp/bin/activate Now python and pip should point to the versions in vp/bin/ . You can install software into the virtual environment via: pip install -r requirements.txt Do this step each time: You will need to activate the virtual environment each time: source vp/bin/activate Then the versions of python and pip that you use will be the ones in the virtual environment. You can deactivate and exit the virtual environment at any time by using: deactivate Build and test site locally using Snakemake To build the site using the Snakefile: snakemake build To view the site use the serve action: snakemake serve and then visit http://localhost:8000 in a browser. If the site does not build, one or more files may need editing. The error output from Snakemake should help you identfy them.

Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors . Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor\u2019s permission is not necessary for any reason\u2013for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright\u2013then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public .

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. Section 1 \u2013 Definitions. a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 \u2013 Scope. a. License grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. Exceptions and Limitations.

The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. Downstream recipients. A. Offer from the Licensor \u2013 Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

Other rights. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 \u2013 License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 \u2013 Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Certain stories are likely to appear in multiple epics and should not be duplicated if possible.","title":"Definitions"},{"location":"r-00001/","text":"R00001 The interface will support GUI web access to end users Use cases that contain this requirement: uc-0001: Researcher Browse and Filter","title":"R00001 The interface will support GUI web access to end users"},{"location":"r-00001/#r00001-the-interface-will-support-gui-web-access-to-end-users","text":"Use cases that contain this requirement: uc-0001: Researcher Browse and Filter","title":"R00001 The interface will support GUI web access to end users"},{"location":"r-00003/","text":"R00003 The interface will support the selection of an Uberon term of interest Use cases that contain this requirement: uc-0001: Researcher Browse and Filter","title":"R00003 The interface will support the selection of an Uberon term of interest"},{"location":"r-00003/#r00003-the-interface-will-support-the-selection-of-an-uberon-term-of-interest","text":"Use cases that contain this requirement: uc-0001: Researcher Browse and Filter","title":"R00003 The interface will support the selection of an Uberon term of interest"},{"location":"t-0001/","text":"T0001 Access CFDE interface Use cases that contain this task: uc-0001: Researcher Browse and Filter","title":"T0001 Access CFDE interface"},{"location":"t-0001/#t0001-access-cfde-interface","text":"Use cases that contain this task: uc-0001: Researcher Browse and Filter","title":"T0001 Access CFDE interface"},{"location":"t-0006/","text":"T0006 Search/filter data sets by anatomic terms Use cases that contain this task: uc-0001: Researcher Browse and Filter","title":"T0006 Search/filter data sets by anatomic terms"},{"location":"t-0006/#t0006-searchfilter-data-sets-by-anatomic-terms","text":"Use cases that contain this task: uc-0001: Researcher Browse and Filter","title":"T0006 Search/filter data sets by anatomic terms"},{"location":"uc-0001/","text":"Researcher Browse and Filter Description Summary Pam wants to build a table of the summarized metadata and summary statistics from each RNA-Seq dataset in the Common Fund that relates to Focal Cortical Dysplasia. Pam logs on to the CFDE interface and searches for brain data, and then filters the results to those studies that used RNASeq. They then search within these results for \"FCD\" or \"Focal Cortical Dysplasia\". Their initial search with cerebral cortex identifies GTEx and HuBMAP as containing information about gene expression in the cortex. Searching with FCD identifies KidsFirst addtional cohorts that included this clinical finding. Using links in these search results, Pam accesses the Program page for each dataset and requests access to the ones that fit their needs. They also send their final table to their postdoc, Lacey, who will do the actual analysis.

Persona Involved: Either the name of the persona that applies to your Use Case, or a description of a new Persona. See current list of personas here User Epics: Write 1-3 epics from the user's perspective (using terms meaningful to the user) to highlight interactions with software tools and resources in the service of achieving the scientific objective. Epics can also be thought of as big tasks, and should be written from the users perspective, e.g.: \"build a dataset\" or \"analyze a dataset\" or \"turn raw sequence into called variants\". User Stories: Write 5-15 concise user stories that describe concrete interactions between the user and tools described above.
