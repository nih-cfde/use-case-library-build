By contributing to this repository, you agree: To obey the Code of Conduct To release all your contributions under the same terms as the license itself: the CC-BY Attribution 4.0 International If you are OK with these two conditions, then we welcome both you and your contribution! How to add content If you have a suggestion for a new use case concept and are not familiar with GitHub, you can email your idea to us . If you are familiar with GitHub please either: Open a NewUseCase issue describing your new use case idea Or write up your use case and submit it as a pull request (PR). Please follow the Use Case Style Guide below. PR process If you are submitting a pull request, please create one pull request per use case so admin can check the complete change. First, add and preview new changes: Fork the use cases repo and create a new branch in your forked version. Use the use case file templates to format and add your new use case files to the appropriate directories on your branch. After you add changes to your branch, you should see a message near the top of the repo page indicating that your branch is x number of commits ahead of nih-cfde:master . There should be a button for 'Pull request' and/or 'Compare' - they lead to the same page to create a PR. Submit a PR from your forked repo branch to the nih-cfde:preview branch. After you submit the PR, make sure the repo checks complete (green check mark) If the checks complete successfully, the repo's bot will auto-merge your changes to the preview branch. Please check your changes on the preview website . It may take ~30 minutes for the changes you added to show up. Please check that the new content renders correctly (e.g., check page format, right-side table of contents links, and page and web hyperlinks) and makes sense relative to existing content. If the checks failed, please submit a HelpWanted issue to request help. Please include a reference (using # ) to your PR so we can check the correct website build logs.

Common user tasks and requirements should be reused across use cases. General File Format The file format for all files should be written in Markdown.

If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c.

However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d.
