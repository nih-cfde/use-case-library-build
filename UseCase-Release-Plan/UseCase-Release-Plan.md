## Release Documentation

The Github repo for the use case library website will host a release section and associated tag information.

For documentation version numbering system we will follow the release semantics with Major and Minor numbering. Thus our release tag would have the format: **`Major.Minor`**

For example October 2020 release would have the tag **`2020.10`**. This would follow the same convention as set for labels on GitHub repo.

A draft of the release notes will be auto generated based on PR merges into `latest`.
To access the draft
- access the `Releases` tab on the main repo page
- click on `Create a new release`
- subsequently click on `Releases`
- use the `Edit` button on the right top corner
- modify the release titles if applicable, add date and save draft

When creating a tag associated with the release notes it is important to tag the correct version of `latest` branch. This can be achieved by choosing correct `Target` branch after the merge of individual PRs into `latest`:
- Update `Target` for tag (**Preferable**)
    - Click the `Edit` option on the autogenerated release draft
    - Enter the tag format in the `Tag version` box
    - Set `Target` branch to stable
    - Click `Publish release` after checking for contents
    - This will create the public release visible on main repo page
