# CFDE Use Case Library Release Plan

This is the release plan for the [CFDE use case website](https://cfde-usecases.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/).

## Release Documentation

The Github repo for the use case library website will host a release section and associated tag information.

For documentation version numbering system we will follow the release semantics with Major and Minor numbering. Thus our release tag would have the format: **`Major.Minor`**

The current version of the use case library is at `v1.0`. Any subsequent updates via PRs to the repo will be documented and can be released as either a `Minor` or `Major` release depending on the scope of the content. For example updates to an existing use case might be tagged with a `Minor` tag as **`v1.1`**.

A draft of the release notes will be auto generated based on PR merges into `latest`.
To access the draft
- access the `Releases` tab on the main repo page
- click on `Create a new release`
- subsequently click on `Releases`
- use the `Edit` button on the right top corner
- modify the release titles if applicable, add date and save draft

When creating a tag associated with the release notes it is important to tag the correct version of `latest` branch. This can be achieved by choosing correct `Target` branch after the merge of individual PRs into `latest`:
- Update `Target` for tag (**Preferable**)
    - Click the `Edit` option on the autogenerated release draft
    - Enter the tag format in the `Tag version` box
    - Set `Target` branch to stable
    - Click `Publish release` after checking for contents
    - This will create the public release visible on main repo page

Note that the very first release draft will not have version number and has to be manually added to the title of the draft as well as the tag. All subsequent release drafts will be automatically versioned and tagged.
