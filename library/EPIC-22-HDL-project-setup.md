Identifying TOPmed records in which HDL has been measured, is primarily a metadata and data access issue: “has HDL been measured for this study? Does person X have access for this research purpose?” These questions can be answered without actual access to the data or logging into dbGaP; the question of whether a particular subject has had HDL measured DOES require access to the study. (Another way to decide this is if it's on dbGaP's ftp site, you can use it without access. If it's not, you need approved access. ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/.)
