Kristin would like to view the metadata associated with her DCC that currently exists
in the CFDE portal.

She logs in to the portal using an existing identity, which takes her to
a restricted page showing summary statistics about what data her DCC currently has
in the portal. This display helps her answer questions like:

-   How many data files exist for her DCC overall?
-   How many subjects are represented?
-   How many and which data types are represented?
-   How many and which anatomy terms are represented?
-   What Project names are associated with her DCC?
-   How many biosamples are in those Projects?
-   How many data_types are in those Projects?

By comparing the summary statistics supplied by the interface, Kristin can determine
whether the data currently available at the CFDE is up to date with her current
internal data holdings, and decide whether it should be released for public view.
