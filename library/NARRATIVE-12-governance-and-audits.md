### Scientific Objective

A Governance Authority (the Authority), is performing a security audit on a resource in the Data Commons. They access the Data Commons user interface for querying the audit trail, and obtain a machine readable statement of research purpose accompanying each (human-readable application for access to data), and an algorithm compares the data use restrictions to the researcher’s purpose and lets them know whether the two are compatible and if manual review is required.
