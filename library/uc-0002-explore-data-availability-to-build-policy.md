# Use Case UC0002 Explore data availability to build policy

**Completed:** June 2020

**Persona:** [Program Officer](../personas/program-officer.md)

**Objective:** [Multiple DCC Comparison](../objectives/multi-dcc-comparison.md)

### Summary

Jon is a leader at the Common Fund, and wants to build summary tables of
Common Fund assets for use in both tracking progress and for finding gaps that
should be filled by future initiatives. They would like to use the CFDE interface
to download simple tables or graphs that show what assets exist, and where.

Using a web browser, Jon uses a point and click interface to get a matrix of
Uberon tissue terms by DCC. With a few more clicks, they get similar tables showing
Species, and Assay Types by Program.

Since these are simple matrices, Jon can re-plot the data in almost any
piece of plotting software, or look at the results in Excel. Jon downloads
the underlying data to add to a report they are making about Common Fund assets.
