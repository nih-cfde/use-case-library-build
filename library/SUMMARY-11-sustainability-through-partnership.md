**Scenario:**

The "GitHub" or "Wikipedia" of biological and life science data.

**Current approach:**

Individual programs that are reinventing the wheel. Domain-specific
Commonses. Proprietary stacks.

**With Data Commons Phase 1:**

Development of a vision that is larger than any single
effort. Strategy for executing the vision. Pilot of the
infrastructure. Open and interoperable infrastructure.

**With Data Commons longer vision:**

Partnerships with NIH ICs, other government agencies, international
groups, and even non-profits, foundations, and industry. Distributed,
collaboratively supported resources—intellectual, technical, and
financial. Investment of effort into working on and adopting standards
in exchange for governance within the Data Commons community. A system
that connects individual efforts and Commonses. Expanded use of NIH
investments. Shared management of large datasets. A platform for
innovation on top of NIH investment to increase value to greater
research community. A new way of thinking about and approaching data
science.
