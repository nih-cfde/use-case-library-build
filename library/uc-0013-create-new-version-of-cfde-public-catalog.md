## have not begun working on this one yet, seems like pretty much all new tasks/reqs
## leaving placeholder task and requirement

CFDE CC team member: creates a new version of the CFDE public catalog


A CFDE CC team member should be able to:

    See a list of Review catalogs that have been approved by their Data Administrators

    See a Preview of the Release catalog if it were updated to include a given approved Review catalog

    Run QC and compliance tests

    Approve or Reject any given Review Catalog

    Provide feedback to each Data Administrator that the Review Catalog was accepted or not, and why

    Place CFDE approved Review Catalogs in a queue for an upcoming Release

    Promote all queued Catalogs to the Release Catalog

    Notify all applicable Data Administrators that their Review Catalogs are now in the Release Catalog


    For Epic 2: This is staying manual. Will circle back post-January.
