**Scenario:**

Natalia is a teacher at a community college. She wants a way for her students to
learn data science processes using real-life data. She does not have the
expertise or resources to do this on her own, but she has experience doing this in graduate
school.

**Current approach:**

She could partner with a high performance computing center at a nearby
university or she could create a synthetic “experiment”.

**With Data Commons Phase 1:**

Natalia can access data and tools on a public website. She can leverage a
standard set of resources in the cloud that support exploratory
investigation of data.

**With Data Commons longer vision:**

She can use training videos and workshops that support continued learning. A community of
developers and users within the Data Commons is available to help support citizen
scientists.
