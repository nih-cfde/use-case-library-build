## checking if this is the same as uc-0004 - plus update of new tasks/requirements
## have added tasks and reqs that already exist. have not added the new ones yet

Data administrator: uses the CFDE Submission Tool to make a Data Submission

A data administrator or their designee should be able to:

t-0013 - is this C2M2 documentation
    - Consult documentation about building their metadata manifest

this is new <- is it the same as the other tutorial task in uc-0009?
    - Follow a minimal example/tutorial for building a metadata manifest

t-0013? - are these still talking about C2M2 docs?
    - Consult technical documentation for in depth model information

t-0015
    - Submit a metadata manifest into the submission tool

r-00025 - a req of t-0015
    - Be authenticated as an approved data submitter

r-00028 - a req of t-0015
    - Be notified of errors that make their manifest incompatible with the model

this is a new req (specifically the Globus part) - may need to add to t-0015
    - Be notified of errors that make their manifest unable to be submitted to the Globus endpoint

is this still t-0013?    
    - Consult documentation on how to resolve any errors

this is new - would be contacting help desk task (a requirement will be that a help desk exists)
    - Be able to contact CFDE support if they cannot resolve errors

this looks new -  new req?
    Receive notification of successful submission of the manifest

this is a new task
    Submit subsequent metadata manifests for comparison
