Ann was notified that her team has new Review Catalogs that need to be reviewed. She logs in to the portal as a recognized Data Administrator for her DCC. After navigating to a Review Catalog belonging to her team, she checks the submission by looking at dynamically generated plots for the catalog.

If any of her team's catalogs are incorrect, she can reject or delete a Review Catalog. If they look correct, she can approve one Review Catalog at a time for her team. Once Ann approves a catalog, she will be notified that 1) her approval has been recorded and 2) the data will appear in the next Release Catalog pending review by the CFDE.

<!-- A data administrator should be able to:

t-0028
    Be notified that they have new Review Catalogs pending Review

t-0017    
    - log into the portal and be recognized as a data administrator from a particular DCC(s)

t-0025 with r-00029       
    - Navigate to any Review Catalog belonging to their own team(s)

this is new task (requirement will be that dynamic plots are generated) - also on uc-0009  
t-0029
    - View a dynamically generated set of plots/Review catalog

t-0027 with r-00029    
    - Reject/delete any available Review Catalogs belonging to their own team(s)

r-00030 (part of t-0016)
    - Approve a single Review Catalog per team they are administrator for

sounds like r-00031 (part of t-0016)
    Be notified that their approval has been recorded and that the data will appear in the next Release Catalog, pending CFDE review -->
