**Scenario**

Brunhilda is interested in building a screening strategy that is tailored to the patients sex. To find sexual dimorphism for her phenotype, she wants to investigate phenotypic differences between males and females in large-scale screening program of a number of genetically modified model organisms.

**Current Approach**

Once Brunhilda had the list of organisms she would like to test, she would have to spend a great deal of time constructing a large dataset. Knock-out libraries for her organims (mouse, rat, zebrafish, xenopus, drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast) would all need to be seperated by sex, and have ontology terms mapped onto the genes so Burnhilda could eventually look for differential expression between sexes for homologous genes. This process would require not only a great deal of time, but a huge amount of domain specific knowledge. From a technology standpoint, libraries from different organisims are usually  stored in different, non-compatible, formats. From a biological standpoint, genetic events like gene and genome duplication events and gene losses would result in non-one-to-one mappings between species.

**With the Data Commons Phase I**

Brunhilda can log into a full stack and access both the model organism data resources in the Alliance of Genomic Resources and the tissue-based gene expression data in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. These data are pre-harmonized, so Brunhilda doesn't need to manually determine how the variables in each are related to one another. After analyzing this data to find differences between male and female biology at genome scale, she can immediately compare her resulting candidate gene list to data from TOPMed.

**With Data Commons longer vision:**

Brunhilda will be able to expand the scope of her study to include many more species and multiple studies of those species. As an early user of the Commons, Brunhilda is invested in improving the metadata mappings, and might also volunteer time with the Data Commons to improve harmonization of new data sets as they are onboarded.
