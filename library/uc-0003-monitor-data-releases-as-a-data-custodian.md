Janice is the PI for data coordinating center. They would like
to use the CFDE interface to help write a progress report for their funding agency.
Using the browse and filter functions on the CFDE interface they create a report
containing relevant summary statistics for datasets owned by their DCC, and
rendered graphs and figures of the summary data. This includes information such
as how much data is currently publicly available on her DCC interface, how much is
uploaded but embargoed, the FAIRness score for these datasets, and how these
statistics have changed over the previous year.
