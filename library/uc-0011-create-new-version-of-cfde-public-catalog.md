Julie logs in to the CFDE portal to check the list of Review Catalogs that have been approved by DCC Data Administrators. She can see a preview of the Release Catalog that includes any updates from recently approved Review catalogs.

Julie runs quality control and compliance tests and then approves or rejects any given Review Catalog. She provides feedback to each Data Administrator that their Review Catalog was either accepted or rejected with an explanation for the decision.

She places approved catalogs in a queue for the next release date, and at the next release, promotes all queued catalogs to the public Release Catalog. All applicable Data Administrators will be notified that their Review Catalogs are now in the Release Catalog.



<!-- A CFDE CC team member should be able to:
DONE t-0016 - or is the CFDE view different from what DCC data admins see to review catalogs?
    - See a list of Review catalogs that have been approved by their Data Administrators

DONE new task - t-0033
    - See a Preview of the Release catalog if it were updated to include a given approved Review catalog

DONE new task - t-0034
    - Run QC and compliance tests

DONE t-0016
    - Approve or Reject any given Review Catalog

DONE t-0035 - since this is specifically a CFDE CC person sending feedback to the DCC data admin, i don't think it would be part of t-0016 which is for any user reviewing submissions
    - Provide feedback to each Data Administrator that the Review Catalog was accepted or not, and why

DONE t-0036
    - Place CFDE approved Review Catalogs in a queue for an upcoming Release


DONE t-0037
    - Promote all queued Catalogs to the Release Catalog


DONE going to make this a requirement r-00045 of t-0037. the interface should notify
    - Notify all applicable Data Administrators that their Review Catalogs are now in the Release Catalog -->
