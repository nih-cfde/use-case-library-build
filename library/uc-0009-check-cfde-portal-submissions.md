Melinda, a Data Custodian, wants to check her team's data submissions on the CFDE portal so they can review which are ready to incorporate into the portal.

She logs on to the portal interface and looks at summaries of her team's data submissions. She navigates to the Review Catalog belonging to her team and views a dynamically generated set of plots. For additional help, she pulls up the Review Page documentation and the walkthrough tutorial.

Next she notifies Ann, a Data Administrator on her team who makes the final decision, that it is time to do a final review of the data.
