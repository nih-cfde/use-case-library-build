Melinda wants to check her team's data submissions on the CFDE portal so they
can review which are ready to incorporate into the portal.

She logs on to the portal interface and looks at summaries of their data submissions.
Next she notifies Ann, a Data Administrator on her team who makes the final decision, that it is time to do a final review of the data.
