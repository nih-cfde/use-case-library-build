Data administrator: installs and configures the CFDE Submission Tools so he can submit new/updated data packages

A Data Administrator from a participating DCC should be able to

r-00042 <- added as a requirement of t-0014
    - consult documentation that describes how to a acquire, install and configure the submission tool

r-00023 of t-0014
    - download or otherwise acquire the submission tool

t-0014
    - install it to their system
    - configure it to correctly associate their data submissions with their DCC in the CFDE system


r-00026 (this is part of t-0015, but this task is not really a part of this particular uc)
    give others on their team the ability to submit on their behalf
