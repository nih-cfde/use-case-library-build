This end user understands computation, and is comfortable with the command line interface (CLI) and at least one other programming language, however they are not experts in biology.

They will primarily interact with the data using an API, and will expect that the data is in a form that can be used by workflow languages. They will rarely work in a point and click interface here, however they may be receive lists of data files to analyze which their less computational colleagues created using the GUI.

### Assumptions

Users with this persona:

-   Has credentialed access to the CFDE
-   Do not require administrative access to an interface
