This end user understands biology, and is comfortable with point and click interfaces,
but does not use the command line or know any programming languages. They have
associated a credential with the CFDE.

They will primarily interact with the data using a web browser or spreadsheets,
and will expect that the data is in a human readable format. They will rarely
work in a coding interface, however they may want to turn data they collected in
a human readable format into a machine readable list that can be used by their
data scientist.

### Assumptions
