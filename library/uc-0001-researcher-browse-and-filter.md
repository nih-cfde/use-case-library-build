### Summary

Pam wants to build a table of the summarized metadata and summary statistics
from each RNA-Seq dataset in the Common Fund that relates to Focal Cortical Dysplasia.

Pam logs on to the CFDE interface and searches for brain data, and then filters the results to those studies that used RNASeq. They then search within these results
for "FCD" or "Focal Cortical Dysplasia".
Their initial search with cerebral cortex identifies GTEx and HuBMAP as containing information about gene expression in the cortex. Searching with FCD identifies KidsFirst addtional cohorts that included this clinical finding.

Using links in these search results, Pam accesses the Program
page for each dataset and requests access to the ones that fit their needs. They also send
their final table to their postdoc, Lacey, who will do the actual analysis.
