Pam wants to build a table of the summarized metadata from each RNA-Seq dataset in the Common Fund that relates to the liver.

Pam connects to the CFDE interface Web site and decides to browse the portal by Project. They narrow the results to studies that used RNA-seq assay type and liver anatomy terms with the Refine search filters. Pam exports the search results by clicking "Export".

Using data portal links on the exported manifest, Pam accesses the Common Fund Program data portals for each dataset, where they can request access to the data that fits their needs. They also send their final table to their postdoc, Lacey, who will do the actual analysis.
