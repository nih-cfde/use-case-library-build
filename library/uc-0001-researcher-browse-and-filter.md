Pam wants to build a table of the summarized metadata and summary statistics from each RNA-Seq dataset in the Common Fund that relates to the brain.

Pam connects to the CFDE interface Web site and decides to browse the portal by Project. They search for brain data and then filter the results to studies that used the RNASeq assay type.

<!-- They then search within these results for "FCD" or "Focal Cortical Dysplasia". Their initial search with cerebral cortex identifies GTEx and HuBMAP as containing information about gene expression in the cortex. Searching with FCD identifies KidsFirst additional cohorts that included this clinical finding. -->

Using links on the exported manifest for these search results, Pam accesses the Common Fund Program page for each dataset, where they can request access to the data that fits their needs. They also send
their final table to their postdoc, Lacey, who will do the actual analysis.
