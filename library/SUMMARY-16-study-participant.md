**Scenario**

As a participant in a study, Jennifer would like to be able to see a summary of how many users and/or analysis projects have utilized data from the study in which she is a participant.

**Current Approach**

Jennifer would have to contact the researcher who ran the study she was in to request this information, and this request could compromise her anonymous status.


**With the Data Commons Phase I**



**With Data Commons longer vision:**

Jennifer can log into a publicly-accessible view, i.e. without having to log into the Commons or otherwise verify/assert her identity as a participant in a given study (which would have the danger of exposing her identity, in addition to being very difficult to assert), and search for her study.
