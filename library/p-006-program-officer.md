This user is an NIH administrator for a Common Fund Program.

This user is interested in ensuring that their programs are meeting NIH goals and
are useful to the scientific community. While they have many of the same interests
as a data-custodian, they will typically be checking in with less frequency, and
are more focused on how the program fits into the Common Fund overall.
