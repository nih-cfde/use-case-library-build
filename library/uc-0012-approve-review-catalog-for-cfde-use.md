Data administrator: approves a Review Catalog for use by CFDE

A data administrator should be able to:

t-0028
    Be notified that they have new Review Catalogs pending Review

t-0017    
    - log into the portal and be recognized as a data administrator from a particular DCC(s)

t-0025 with r-00029       
    - Navigate to any Review Catalog belonging to their own team(s)

this is new task (requirement will be that dynamic plots are generated) - also on uc-0009    
    - View a dynamically generated set of plots/Review catalog

t-0027 with r-00029    
    - Reject/delete any available Review Catalogs belonging to their own team(s)

r-00030 (part of t-0016)
    - Approve a single Review Catalog per team they are administrator for

sounds like r-00031 (part of t-0016)
    Be notified that their approval has been recorded and that the data will appear in the next Release Catalog, pending CFDE review
